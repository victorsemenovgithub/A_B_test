# A_B_test
This is simply streamlit app for A/B testisting for dataframe with multiply parameters.

I use it for provide express research of different periods of time, for example "good" period and "bad" period in anomaly detection project.

You can clone repo and use command in the terminal
```bash
python -m streamlit run main.py
```
**For testing** use file LKOH_price.py. 
After downloading file in stream lit dashboard pick columns "price". 
You can see the first period is 2020 year and the second 2022 on default.
You should pick your period for research.
In the bottom there is a diagram for illustrating the shape of two distributions.
